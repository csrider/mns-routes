<p>This screen allows you to draw egress routes for emergency types of messages that can then be shown on the LCD component of a MediaPort Graphical Annunciator (GA) device, customized to its particular location. 
Once the initial setup is complete, routes will automatically display on their assigned display device, for a particular message launch.</p>

<div style="font-weight:bold;">Overview &amp; Routing Concepts:</div>
<ul>
	<li>A graphical annunciator (MediaPort Panel GA) is able to display egress routes and locations/status of safety devices (smoke detectors, pull stations, etc.) on a map.
		<ul>
		<li>A map can display with or without routes (see Message Requirements below, for more details), in order to facilitate communication of the message to all types of audiences.</li>
		<li>Properly placed safety devices (smoke detectors, pull stations, etc.) are able to be displayed on the map, and also indicate their current state upon event trigger or otherwise.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Routes are message-based... That is, when you work with routes, you are working within the scope of a single particular message at a time, no matter the number  
	of graphical annunciator display devices or routes that you may be working with.
		<ul>
		<li>You must enter the Routing Manager through a message definition/editor screen - NOT the locations screen.</li>
		<li>A single message can cause multiple graphical annunciator devices to each display their own pertinent maps and unique set of routes.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Upon message launch, pre-drawn routes will be generated on each individual graphical annunciator LCD device, specific to its location. Each device is 
	capable of automatically displaying a "You Are Here" icon and determining which pre-defined, associated routes it will display along with it. This way, people who 
	happen to be in the area of that device will see an egress route(s) tailored specifically for that location.</li>
	<li>A single display device may have none, one or many routes (this might, for example, be useful in the case where a single LCD is being used in a large room 
	that contains many possible exit paths). This might also be useful if your policies require having alternate routes. Each route can have its own 
	colors, sizes, etc., to help distinguish it per whatever requirements you may have.</li>
	<li>The system also supports multiple floorplan or map graphics, each with their own potential set of routes. Even though a single LCD-GA device, by its nature, is 
	only capable of showing one graphic at a time (full screen), additional graphics (and routes) can be entered into the system, and be told whether to display (active) 
	or not (inactive). This allows a full range of flexibility in how you create and manage all of your possible egress routes through any situation.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-weight:bold;">Security Considerations and Access to Routing:</div>
<ul>
	<li>To gain access to routing, you MUST be a member of the "SYS ROUTING CONTROL" user list.</li>
	<li>Being a member of the "SYS LOCATIONS ACCESS LIST" or any other "LOCATIONS"-type of list will <strong>NOT</strong> gain you access to the routing manager.</li>
	<li>The device(s) that the message will be sent to must be of the "MediaPort Panel GA" type.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-weight:bold;">Message Requirements When Working with Routes:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Create/save a message, as you would any normal message to an LCD device, but with the following special considerations:
		<ul>
		<li>Be sure that the <strong>Sign Group</strong> contains at least one device of the "MediaPort Panel GA" type.</li>
		<li>Select a <strong>Media Type</strong> of "LCD Location Map", and be sure to import/define the proper floorplan graphic.</li>
		<li>Select an <strong>Alert Status</strong> of "Emergency," "Shelter," or "Evacuate" in order to display routes.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, select an <strong>Alert Status</strong> of "Graphical Annunciator" to make the message display a map without routes (useful for response personnel who may be more concerned with a higher-level view of a situation). Note that this 
		mode will still display safety devices (and their alarm states) and "You-are-here" icons (if applicable). It is everything but the routes.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Once the proper Media Type has been defined, and if you have the proper user list clearance, there will be a button available after saving the message, labeled "Edit Map Features." 
	You may then click that button to enter the Routing Manager screen for the particular message. This is the <strong>only</strong> way to enter the Routing Manager.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-weight:bold;">Accessing the Routing Manager:</div>
<p>After clicking <button style="margin-left:4px;">Edit Map Features</button> in the message editor screen (only available if you have proper security clearance), you will be taken to a screen looking very much like the usual Locations screen. 
However, in this context, it is referred to as the "Device Manager" screen. The purpose of the Device Manager is solely to offer you the convenience of placing LCD/device icons directly without having to 
change screens and go back to the Locations screen, explicitly. If you make any device changes here, be sure to click <img src="gifs/done.gif"> to save your changes, before proceeding to the Routing Manager.</p>
<p>Once you have finished moving, or placing LCD devices and assigning their names to them (see <a href="pagehelp.html#page_locations_manager" target="_blank">help for Locations</a> - it is the same process) -- or they have already been placed and named -- 
then you may continue to the Route Manager screen by clicking on the <img src="gifs/routeMgrBtn.gif"> button.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip: Once you're on the Routing Manager screen, you may simply move your mouse cursor over most buttons or items to get an instant help pop-up explaining its status or function. This will be your best bet for understanding the plethora of options available in this tool!</p>

<div style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:3px;">Routing Manager Screen (Toolbar):</div>
<div><img src="gifs/routingToolbar.gif" class="indent"></div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Message:</strong> This indicates the message you are currently working in <em>(remember that routes are message-based)</em>.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/map_route_add.gif">Click this button to add a new route, and then click an LCD icon to select it for adding the new route to. Routes must have an associated LCD!</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/showRoute.gif">Click this button to view existing route(s), and then click an LCD icon to select it and view the route(s) that it will display for this message.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/more.gif">Only available if a multi-route LCD has been selected, click to view additional/alternate routes for the selected LCD.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/maps_button.gif">Only available if a LCD is currently selected (with route showing) that has additional map(s)/route(s) defined, use this to activate/deactivate 
	various possible maps/routes.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/routingColorChooserRed.gif">Only available when adding/editing a route, click to choose the color of the route path line.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/routingThickChooser.gif">Only available when adding/editing a route, click to choose the thickness of the route path line. The darker highlight indicates
	the currently selected/applied thickness... the middle "normal" thickness is the default.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/straighten1.gif">Only available when adding/editing a route, click to turn on/off the horizontal and vertical straight line assist. This will help you 
	make perfectly horizontal or perfectly vertical line segments. It works similar to a "snap-to" that is used by many other software applications. Note that you 
	may wish to turn this off if you are placing points in very close proximity to each other, or drawing tight curves. The checkbox will tick/untick to indicate current status.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/saveRoute.gif">Only available when adding/editing a route and it has not been saved, click to save the route as it currently appears on the screen.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/undo.gif">Only available if a route is currently showing, click to erase the last line segment. Repeat as many times as desired.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/map_route_delete.gif">Only available if a route is currently showing, click to delete the route that is currently showing on the screen. Deletes cannot be undone.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/help2.gif">Click to view a quick-help guide.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/refresh.gif">Click to refresh the routing manager page. This reloads all route data for the message; so it may be useful, for example, if you are 
	collaborating with another person in drawing a route, and wish to see what he or she has saved so far. If a route is currently showing when you click this, 
	that route will be reloaded on your screen to its most recently saved state. Any unsaved changes to the route, on your screen, will be lost.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/deviceMgrBtn.gif">Click to return to the device manager screen. Any unsaved changes will be lost.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/cancel_red_x.gif">Click to close the routing manager window altogether. Any unsaved changes will be lost.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:3px;">Routing Manager Screen (Drawing Canvas Area):</div>
<div><img src="gifs/routingCanvasSample.gif" class="indent"></div>
<ul>
	<li><img src="gifs/map_mediaport_with_route_connected.gif">LCD with associated routes for the message. This animated icon will display if the LCD has one or more routes associated with it for the current message. 
	You may then, for example, click <img src="gifs/showRoute.gif"> and then this icon to view its route(s).</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/map_mediaport_map_off_with_route_connected.gif">LCD with associated routes for the message, but the currently loaded map (and any visible routes) is not set as active - meaning this will not display when the message is launched. 
	You may then, for example, click <img src="gifs/showRoute.gif"> and then this icon to view its currently inactive route(s). Furthermore, you may then click <img src="gifs/maps_button.gif"> to change which maps/routes are active or not.</li>
	<li><img src="gifs/map_mediaport_connected.gif">LCD without any associated routes for the active message.</li>
	<li>Note: There are also "not-connected" versions of these that would display if the LCD is not currently online or connected. Here is what those would look like: <img src="gifs/map_mediaport_with_route_not_connected.gif">, 
	<img src="gifs/map_mediaport_map_off_with_route_not_connected.gif">, and <img src="gifs/map_mediaport_not_connected.gif"></li>
</ul>
